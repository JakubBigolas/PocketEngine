To compile engine bin resources in one engine.sh file use script like this:

# go to engine direcotry
cd [...]/engine

# compile all files in one script
echo "" > engine.sh   ;   for f in `ls bin` ; do echo "# $f" >> engine.sh ; cat "bin/$f" >> engine.sh ; echo "" >> engine.sh ; done   ;   echo "engine \"\$@\"" >> engine.sh





To build only engin-embed.sh use script like this

# go to engine direcotry
cd [...]/engine

# run script to get function and print its result to engine-embed.sh
. bin/engine-embed.sh && engineEmbed > engine-embed.sh
